# The Whiley Compiler

The Whiley Compiler (WyC) is one component of the larger [Whiley Build Tool](https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyBuildTool).  When you run `wy build` on the command line, you are running the build tool which, in turn, runs the Whiley Compiler (amongst other things).

## Installation

The easiest way to get started with Whiley is by running it in your web-browser on [whileylabs.com](http://whileylabs.com).  To run Whiley from the command-line (e.g. `wy build`), see instructions for installing the [Whiley Build Tool](https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyBuildTool).  You can find more information about Whiley at [whiley.org](https://whiley.org).
