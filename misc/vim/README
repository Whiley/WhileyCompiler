This is a vim syntax file for the Whiley programming language. It tells vim
which parts of the language are to be highlighted, and how to highlight them.
Whiley is the brainchild of Dr. David Pearce, and more information, and a
compiler, are avaliable from http://www.Whiley.org.

INSTALLATION
------------
Installation is the same as any vim syntax file, and is not complex. Move the
`Whiley.vim` file to

    $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/Whiley.vim

for a system wide install, or to

    ~/.vim[files]/syntax/Whiley.vim

for a single user install. NOTE: You may have to create the `syntax/` directory
in your `~/.vim/` directory.

Once you have moved the syntax file into the correct directory, open up your
`.vimrc` and add the following line:

    "Recognize whiley file type
    augroup filetypedetect
    au BufNewFile,BufRead *.whiley  setf whiley
    augroup END


this should set everything up properly, so that you can see Whiley syntax
highlighting in `.whiley` files.

To enable highlighting of trailing whitespace, and tabs mixed with spaces, type
the following into vim:

    :let whiley_space_error_highlighting=1
    :set syntax=whiley

To disable it again, type this:

    :unlet whiley_space_error_highlighting
    :set syntax=whiley

The reason you have to type `:set syntax=whiley` each time is to force vim to
reload the syntax definitions from file, and rehighlight the contents of the
buffer.
