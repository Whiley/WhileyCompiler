### The Whiley Compiler Collection

The `WhileyCompiler` is part of the
[Whiley Compiler Collection](https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompilerCollection).
This is the overarching framework which brings together components for
compiling, verifying, testing and documenting Whiley programs (and
much more).  The `WhileyCompiler` compiler can be thought of as a
"plugin" within this framework.

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Reporting bugs is a useful and rewarding way of contributing.  Please
use the issue tracker and try, as much as possible, to provide minimal
examples which illustrate the problem along with a clear description
of what happened.

### Making Pull Requests

You are welcome to make pull requests to this project.  **Small** pull
requests are likely to be accepted quickly.  **Large** pull requests may
involve further discussion and peer review.

Please *do not* include lines such as the following on the files you
modify:

```

```

Such lines are tedious to manage and unnecessary.  The commit history
of the project is sufficient evidence of your contribution.
