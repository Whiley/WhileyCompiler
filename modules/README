Package Summary
======================================================================

wyc/ ---- The compiler front-end, including all code for the lexer,
          the parser, the raw AST, and various tools for instantiating
          and configuring a Whiley Compiler.

wyil/ --- The Whiley Intermediate Language (wyil).  The Whiley
          Compiler (wyc) converts Whiley programs into this
          intermediate language, and then various transforms are
          applied.  The wyil constitutes a bytecode (similar, in some
          ways, to Java Bytecode) which can be interpreted and
          executed on its own (if desired).  This package includes
          code for performing type checking, constant propagation, and
          various other manipulations.  Furthermore, all the necessary
          code for manipulating structural types in Whiley is included
          here.  In short, this package constitutes the bulk of the
          compiler.
