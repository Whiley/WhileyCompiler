Package Summary
======================================================================

wyc/ ---- The compiler front-end, including all code for the lexer,
          the parser, the raw AST, and various tools for instantiating
          and configuring a Whiley Compiler.

wyil/ --- The Whiley Intermediate Language (wyil).  The Whiley
          Compiler (wyc) converts Whiley programs into this
          intermediate language, and then various transforms are
          applied.  The wyil constitutes a bytecode (similar, in some
          ways, to Java Bytecode) which can be interpreted and
          executed on its own (if desired).  This package includes
          code for performing type checking, constant propagation, and
          various other manipulations.  Furthermore, all the necessary
          code for manipulating structural types in Whiley is included
          here.  In short, this package constitutes the bulk of the
          compiler.

wyjc/ --- The Whiley-to-Java Compiler.  This extends the Whiley
          Compiler (wyc) with additional transforms for converting
          wyil code into Java bytecode.

wyjvm/ -- The Whiley JVM library.  This library is used for generating
          valid Java bytecode.  It abstracts the various bytecodes and
          their different forms and takes care of their optimal
          translation into actual JVM bytecodes.  In addition, it
          handles various annoying aspects of Java bytecode, such as
          ensuring wide branches are used when necessary.  Finally,
          passes are provided for eliminating dead-code and santity
          checking the generated bytecode.

wyautl/ - The Whiley Automata Library.  This library is used for
          representing and manipulating finite tree automata.  These
          automata are used as the underlying representation of types
          in Whiley, and there are a number of relatively complex
          algorithms required to manipulate them.  For example, for
          representing automatas in canonical form.
